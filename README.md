# TSMS-with-Data-Analysis
Taxi Station Management System with data collection for analysis

As our final year project, my group member and I have taken up the task of helping Chraa Taxi Station in Sunyani, Bono Region, Ghana,
to manage their operations and collect and store information that will serve as records and also a means to carry out statistical analysis.

As these days Information Technology has become a tool of improvement in transportation, we work to provide the taxi station with a means of also using information technology means to make their otherwise manual and tedious work more easy, fast and effective.

# Chraa Taxi Station Operations:
This is how operations are initially carried out at the station.
A monthly operation roaster or queue of all available vehicles is done by the station manager and by which the drivers queue up their vehicles for operation. Whenever a driver loads up, he pays station dues before setting from the station.

The monthly vehicle queue is done manually using white board and a marker, and the white board is put in an only-authorized room as a means of backup whiles the another white board is put outside for all drivers to see. The station dues collector also uses a pen and paper to collect and record the dues paid by drivers which does not ensure proper recording and even analysis.

# Overview of the System
This web based System ensures the role computing resources would play in making their operations more digitized and effective. Records will be stored and retrieved when needed. Data will be collected and stored for future reference and analysis.

The system employs the use of:
    # mysql database(phpmyadmin)  as a database storage for all driver, vehicle, daily operation, dues collection, etc.
    # monthly generation of vehicle queues for operation
    # store all records
    # Give passengers a chance to make a report on drivers' conduct at work

# Import tsms.sql into phpmyadmin to access the database
